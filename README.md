# lllIIIIlll GitHub Actions

Custom GitHub Actions for lllIIIIlll.

**When using these workflows, please consider whether you want to freeze the version of the workflow (more stability), or always use the latest available. Refer to [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#calling-a-reusable-workflow) for more details.**

Many of these actions make use of the `github.token` input as well as `NEXUS_USER` and `NEXUS_PASSWORD` secrets. The first is provided automatically by GitHub Actions, and the NEXUS secrets are available for all repositories within the lllIIIIlll GitHub organisation. and should not need to be set manually.
